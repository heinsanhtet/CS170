# Fall 2022 CS170 Project Skeleton
This repository contains utility functions which might be helpful for solving the project.

## Requirements
`python >= 3.6` is needed for `starter.py`, which contains a handful of utility functions, to run properly; it was, nevertheless, developed in python 3.9.  
Jupyter Notebook is required should you prefer using `main.ipynb`.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
**GREEDY**

To run the Greedy file:
1. Open the GREEDY.ipynb
2. First, install the packages that are needed to run the program
3. Then, import any libraries that are also needed to run the program.
4. If you haven't created any inputs, you can create the inputs in the Phase 1
5. If you have created the inputs, you can run our **solve()** function which impolements the Greedy method in the Phase 2. 
6. To visualize the partitions (teams) that are created, run the section below the **solve()**
7. To check the cost of each graph, you can start the run/run_all() function.
8. Make sure to clear the outputs if you want to run other algorithms.

**METIS**

To run the Metis file:
1. Open the METIS.ipynb
2. First, install the packages that are needed to run the program (PYMETIS)
3. Then, import any libraries that are also needed to run the program. (PYMETIS)
4. If you haven't created any inputs, you can create the inputs in the Phase 1 
5. If you have created the inputs, you can run our **solve()** function which impolements the METIS method in the Phase 2. 
6. To visualize the partitions (teams) that are created, run the section below the **solve()**
7. To check the cost of each graph, you can start the run/run_all() function. 
8. 8. Make sure to clear the outputs if you want to run other algorithms.

**Scikit-learn using Spectral Clustering

To run the Spectral file:
1. Open the SPECTRAL.ipynb
2. First, install the packages that are needed to run the program (SKLEARN & SCIKIT-NETWORK)
3. Then, import any libraries that are also needed to run the program. (SKLEARN, Spectral Clustering, Normalized Mutual Info Score)
4. If you haven't created any inputs, you can create the inputs in the Phase 1 
5. If you have created the inputs, you can run our **solve()** function which impolements the Spectral Clustering method in the Phase 2. 
6. To visualize the partitions (teams) that are created, run the section below the **solve()**
7. To check the cost of each graph, you can start the run/run_all() function. 
8. 8. Make sure to clear the outputs if you want to run other algorithms.
